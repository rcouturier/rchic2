Reads the data, prepare the data and call similarityTree.

\details{
This function allows you to compute the similarity tree. The similarity measure is symetric. At the end of the computation we obtain the similarity tree, 
as follows. In this tree, couple of variables are gathered according to their similarity measure. Significant levels
are highlighted in red. A significant level means that the considered level is more significant than the previous level
and than the next one. In the following figure and in all the cases, an expert must choose according to his knowledge
what is the threshold in the similarity tree after which the similarity measure is not significant for the data considered.
In general the last classes in the similarity tree are not significant. On this figure, we can remark that the strongest 
class is: strong powerful. In this case, this two variables are very similar. The 
second strongest class is: large heavy.
